Our field researchers have confirmed an extraordinary sighting of a beautiful unicorn grazing peacefully in the Scottish
Highlands near Loch Ness. This marks the first confirmed sighting in the region for over three months.

The unicorn, described as having a pristine white coat with an opalescent horn, was observed for approximately 20
minutes before gracefully disappearing into the morning mist. Local residents reported seeing unusual rainbow formations
in the sky shortly after the sighting.

This discovery gives us renewed hope in our conservation efforts and reinforces the importance of protecting these
magical creatures and their natural habitats.
